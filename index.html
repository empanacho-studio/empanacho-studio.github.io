            I think I have a sense of complex <a href="https://github.com/empanacho/in-the-search-of-the-one-true-empanada/discussions/3"> logic to work on</a>. I think I will have a set of skills the player can gain and difficulties through the journey.
        </p>
        <p>
        The complex one is the peering into reality. I imagine this could provide a few paths Empanacho can take. How to show that? I dunno yet. I like the connection with the nose as in <em><b>knows</b></em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still dunno the enemies Empanacho can encounter. I'm inclining for interdimensional beings.

            I took another training course for Unity. I think I'm done. I got enough to create the game. During the training, I remember Chet and Falling. Two other games I have in mind that now I can easily see how to create them but I got to focus my energy on Empanacho for now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started working on <a href="https://github.com/empanacho/in-the-search-of-the-one-true-empanada/discussions/2">the game design of Empanacho</a>. I feel pretty confident with I have come up with. But this means it will take a lot of work to finish it ðŸ˜¬ but hey I'm unemployed so I have time ðŸ¥².
        </p>
        <p>
            I think it's time to start carrying my notebook to all places for sketching ideas and plans.

            Ah! And I changed the logo for Empanacho Studio. I'm more satified with new one even though it's not exactly a logo but who cares this is my creation and I want it like this.

            I started <a href="https://github.com/empanacho/in-the-search-of-the-one-true-empanada">the Unity project</a>. I haven't done Unity before so I took a few official tutorials. So far C# seems quite simple or maybe it's because I have been coding for a decade now. Not that I'm good at it. I consider myself mediocre program writer with flashes of genius.

            Also wrote <a href="https://github.com/orgs/empanacho/discussions">the folklore of Empanacho verse</a>.

            The difficult part, thuogh, will be the artistic aspect of the project. I have hopes in all those AI for image creation and shirt. The logo, for starters, was made with midjourney. I have no idea what kind of prompt i will need for landscapes and animated sprites. I pressume I just need to use the same seed? I dunno.
